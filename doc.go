Package goebpf provides simple and convenient interface to Linux eBPF system.

Overview

Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) is a highly flexible and efficient virtual machine
in the Linux kernel allowing to execute bytecode at various hook points in a safe manner.
It is actually close to kernel modules which can provide the same functionality,
but without cost of kernel panic if something went wrong.

The library is intended to simplify work with eBPF programs.
It takes care of low level routine implementation to make it easy to load/run/manage eBPF programs.
Currently supported functionality:
- Read / parse clang/llmv compiled binaries for eBPF programs / maps
- Creates / loads eBPF program / eBPF maps into kernel
- Provides simple interface to interact with eBPF maps
- Has mock versions of eBPF objects (program, map, etc) in order to make writing unittests simple.

XDP

eXpress Data Path - provides a bare metal, high performance, programmable packet processing
at the closest at possible point to network driver. That makes it ideal for speed without
compromising programmability. Key benefits includes following:

- It does not require any specialized hardware (program works in kernelâ€™s "VM")
- It does not require kernel bypass
- It does not replace the TCP/IP stack

Considering very simple and highly effective way to DROP all packets from given source IPv4 address:

XDP program (written in C):

	// Simple map to count dropped packets
	BPF_MAP_DEF(drops) = {
	    .map_type = BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY,
	    .key_size = 4,
	    .value_size = 8,
	    .max_entries = 1,
	};
	BPF_MAP_ADD(drops);

	SEC("xdp")
	int xdp_drop(struct xdp_md *ctx)
	{
	    if (found) { // If some condition (e.g. SRC IP) matches...
	        __u32 idx = 0;
	        // Increase stat by 1
	        __u64 *stat = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&drops, &idx);
	        if (stat) {
	            *stat += 1;
	        }
	        return XDP_DROP;
	    }
	    return XDP_PASS;
	}

Once compiled can be used by goebpf in the following way:

	bpf := goebpf.NewDefaultEbpfSystem()
	err := bpf.LoadElf("xdp.elf")
	program := bpf.GetProgramByName("xdp_drop") // name matches function name in C
	err = program.Load() // Load program into kernel
	err = program.Attach("eth0") // Attach to interface
	defer program.Detach()

	// Interact with program is simply done through maps:
	drops := bpf.GetMapByName("drops") // name also matches BPF_MAP_ADD(drops)
	val, err := drops.LookupInt(0) // Get value from map at index 0
	if err == nil {
	    fmt.Printf("Drops: %d\n", val)
	}
